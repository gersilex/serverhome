Serverhome
==========

------------
`DEPRECATION NOTICE`
Development is stopped in order to contribute to a more promising project: https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall

------------

Serverhome is a small web server / web service that reads a YAML configuration file and starts on TCP port 3000 by default. It displays a Navbar designed with Bootstrap 3 and displays the health-checked services within the Navbar.

![Example Image](https://github.com/gersilex/serverhome/raw/master/image.png)

This package contains the backend and the frontend which is served by the backend's web server. When the frontend calls the API for services and their states, the backend immediately returns all of the services and their last known states. It also queries all the services for their new states and saves them in-memory, to be served on the next query by a frontend.

This means the service is always one check behind reality to increase responsiveness and should be asked regularily. The frontend sends a query every 2 seconds and increases the interval by 1 % per query up to **two minutes** to mitigate accidental DoS'es (I have done this way too often).

Installation
------------

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gersilex/serverhome.git
cd serverhome
npm install
```

Configuration
-------------

Create a `config.yml` in the root directory. Have a look at the `config.yml.spec` for a working example. Here is the format and what is what:

```yaml
default:            # This is the default scope and everything must be contained within here. The order is preserved.
  MyWebService:     # This is the name of your first service. The key name will be displayed in the navbar.
    uri: (String)   # Here comes the URL to your service. If it returns a code of >200 and <400 the service will turn green.
    healthcheck: (String) # Here comes the URL which will be checked instead of the uri value. 
  AnotherService:   # Next service
      uri: (String)   # The URI of AnotherService
    ...
```

A working `config.yml` looks like this:

```yaml
default:
  Router:
    uri: http://router
  NAS:
    uri: http://nas
    healthcheck: http://nas/manage/health
  Kodi:
    uri: http://media:8080
  Drucker:
    uri: http://drucker
```

You can create a file `public/logo.png` and it will be displayed centered if no service was clicked, yet or there were errors. This can be changed in `public/index.html`.

Run it
------

```sh
npm start
```

Docker
------

Build the image with the bundled Dockerfile:

```sh
docker build -t serverhome:latest .
```

Run it:

```sh
docker run -it -v /tmp/config.yml:/app/config.yml -p3000:3000 serverhome:latest
```

Caveats
-------

- Twitter Bootstrap 3 is included from MaxCDN. This means you need to have internet access to have a working CSS design. This is because I was lazy.
- If a services denies CORS, then we cannot open it in the main iframe. Nothing will happen and the user has to middle-click/ open in new tab.
- If the service in the iframe displays an error, it is likely that there will be black text on the grey background. This will be hard to read.

Contribution
------------

You are welcome to open issues, fork and improve the code, design and documenation.
